# Advent of Code 2024

This repository is hosted at `https://gitlab.com/draget-advent-of-code/aoc2024` and only mirrored to GitHub.

Draget's (Michael G) solutions to Advent of Code 2024. The goal is not only to solve the tasks, but add a little something each time to grow my skills in different areas.

All new aspects are documented in the [changes](#changelog) section below.

## Technology

This project is based on [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

## Building and running

* Build: `./ampere build`
* Test: `./ampere test`
* Run: `./ampere run`

## Contributing

Even if I want to learn myself, I still very much appreciate if you want to make suggestions or tell me how I can do something better, by raising an issue or suggesting a change in a MR. While I doubt anyone would do that for a AoC repository, input is still welcome!

## Changelog

### 2024-12-01
